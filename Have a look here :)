Decision tree algorithm belongs to the family Supervised Learning algorithms. The objective of this algorithm is to create a training model which can use to predict class or value of target variables by learning decision rules inferred from prior data i.e. training data.
Here I have performed a prediction on availability of fake notes. 
The language used is python3 
platform : Google collabotary
